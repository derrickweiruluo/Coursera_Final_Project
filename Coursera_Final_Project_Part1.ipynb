    "Restaurants are a notoriously difficult business to own or operate. Not only is it a relatively capital and employee-intensive business, restaurants are also highly regulated, low margin. New York City is a high-competitve market, where there are many restaurant closed and opened everyday, for every cuisine style. Even on the same neighourhood, there will be customers that are willing to wait for 30 minutes to get into a restaurant while another restaurant may not even have its table fully occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key element of success of opening a restaurant is the selection of location.It comes down to a combination of several factors: restaurant style, target customers, rent and nearby competitors. In New York City, one of the most high-populated and diverse city in the world, the opportunity for the running a restaurant is enormous. Selecting location is the first step that require a lot of research and most likely irreversable afterward.  Thus, a good location will pave the path toward success. In this project, data science will provide valuable insights regarding market trends and evolving consumer lifestyles so that restaurateurs can better address and meet public demand."
